"Better Commit" is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension that enforces standardized commit messages, ensuring convention and consistency across Git repositories. By utilizing predefined commit templates, it streamlines the commit process, promoting a unified style within development teams. Improve collaboration and project clarity with this efficient tool, creating clean, informative, and consistent commit histories effortlessly.

## Commit Message Format

Each commit message embodies a:
    </br>1. <b>category</b> (feat, fix, docs, ...).</br>
    2. <b>summary</b> - provide a succinct description of the change.

### Template

Structure of the commit message:

Category | Summary
---  | ---
**feat** | Add a new feature
**fix** | A bug fix
**docs** | Documentation only changes
**style** | Markup, white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons... no code change
**refactor** | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
**perf** | A code change that improves performance
**test** | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
**chore** | Update build scripts, package manager configs, etc; no production code change


### Summary Format

The summary consists of a concise description of the changes made:

-   use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
