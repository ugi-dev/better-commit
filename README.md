# ⚙️ Better Commit 

"Better Commit" is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension that enforces standardized commit messages, ensuring convention and consistency across Git repositories. By utilizing predefined commit templates, it streamlines the commit process, promoting a unified style within development teams. Improve collaboration and project clarity with this efficient tool, creating clean, informative, and consistent commit histories effortlessly.

## Commit Message Format

Each commit message embodies a:
    </br>1. <b>category</b> (feat, fix, docs, ...).</br>
    2. <b>summary</b> - provide a succinct description of the change.

### Template

**feat** | Add a new feature
**fix** | Fix a bug
**docs** | Modify documentation changes only

**remove** | Remove a file, code or directory
**perf** | A code change that improves performance
**test** | Adding test or correcting existing test
**chore** | Update build scripts, package manager configs, etc; no production code change
